# Idol demo

Speridlabs Gradio demo. `app.py` is the UI; `model.py` is the model.
`examples/presets.json` lists each example image with the settings it is run with.

The Space needs an `HF_TOKEN` secret from an account with access to
`facebook/dinov3-vith16plus-pretrain-lvd1689m` and `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev` (the image encoders).
